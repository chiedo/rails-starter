Rspec testing notes
=====================
- Before anything, you should probably read through the github repo: https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/blob/master/README.md. I will not repeat what is already in the documentation.
- A great tutorial for understanding some of the basics: http://everydayrails.com/2012/03/12/testing-series-intro.html (There are four parts). Notice though that he uses the old "should" style as opoosed to "expect"
