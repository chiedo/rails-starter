Rspec testing resources
=====================
- Official Rspec-rails Docs: 
-- https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/blob/master/README.md (I will not repeat what is already in this documentation.)
- A great tutorial for understanding some of the basics of testing with rspec and getting a general understanding:
-- http://everydayrails.com/2012/03/12/testing-series-intro.html (There are five parts).
--- Notice though that he uses the old "should" style as opoosed to "expect().to"
- Official mocha Docs:
-- https://github.com/freerange/mocha
