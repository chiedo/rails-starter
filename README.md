A framework for a new rails 4.2.0/ruby 2.2 project for setting up the development environment.

##Local Setup
- Make sure you have an environment variable set up on your host machine which sets RAILS_ENV to development.
- Create an .env file with the following contents within your application directory (Update the port, username and password in accordance with your local database setup)

        #MYSQL
        MYSQL_DATABASE=YOURAPPNAME_development
        MYSQL_USER=root
        MYSQL_PASS=root
        MYSQL_HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1
        MYSQL_PORT=8889
        SECRET_KEY_BASE=MAKE_SOMETHING_UP

- Be sure to include 'bundle exec' before any rails commands, etc.

- Be sure to run `bundle exec rake db:create` and `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
