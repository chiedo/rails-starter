- Once inside your vagrant virtual machine, navigate to /vagrant and you are ready to start your rails app by running the following:
```
gem install rails
rails new app_name
```
###Notes:
>* If you have an issue with mysql not connecting, you may need to restart mysql by running 'sudo service mysql restart'
>* Be sure to delete the .git folder after cloning this repo if you intend to use it for a completely unrelated project.

###Notes for elastic beanstalk users:
>* Install Elastic Beanstalk command line tools. If using a mac, you can use homebrew and use the following:
```
brew install aws-elasticbeanstalk
```
>* Before you can push to Elastic Beanstalk for the first time, you will need to navigate to your git repo on your local machine then run the following
```
eb init
```
>*AFTER YOU DO THIS, MAKE SURE .elasticbeanstalk/ and .ebextensions/ ARE NOT in .gitignore.
>* It is recommended that after you run 'eb init', you update the path to your AWS credential file as found in /.elasticbeanstalk/config to /usr/local/AWS/.elasticbeanstalk/ENVIRONMENTNAME_credentials being sure to move the original file to the new path. You will likely have to create that path. This will prevent collisions when you have multiple projects using Elastic Beanstalk on one machine.
