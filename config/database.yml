# Your rspec tests will run faster with this option set as they will run in ram. Obviously, they won't be running on the
# same adapter as your live code base so you can make the decision for yourself on if it is worth the trade off. In most
# cases, this is the way to go. You may use the above instead though if you decide that you want the identical test
# environment that the above can provide you with.
