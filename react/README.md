Reactjs
=========
Notes
------------
This is not to demostrate how to create a reactjs app, best practices or anything like that. This to show you how to connect a Reactjs app to your rails project in a way that maintains reactjs independence but also allow you to just use react for certain components. You at this point, would be free to set up the Flux Architecture, etc. an set up your project. If you end up using a javascript router, be sure to turn off turbolinks.

Development
------------
While developing in Reactjs, you will need to have the following running in a window on your host machine, in the rails root directory.
```
gulp watch
```

Notes
-------------
You will see that we are using reactjs to handle routing for the react app. We are doing this by having a catch-all route in the config/routes.rb file. For demostration purposes, you can see that the following routes are responded to/handled by reactjs "/react-car", "/react-bus"
